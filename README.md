# Claude_computer_use-WindowsWeb
The Windows version, compiled based on the Claude_computer_use_demo project, can be easily run on a local computer.

# Prepare
To use this, you'll need an Anthropic API key. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for free at [console.anthropic.com.](https://console.anthropic.com/)

# Getting Started
1.clone the repository to your local folder

2.open the package, and run run.bat. 

3.Wait for the installation to complete, and the application will automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:8503/.

( After sending a command, you can quickly minimize the browser window to allow Claude to observe your desktop more effectively.）

**That's it, you're all set!**




**Tip:** If the application doesn’t open successfully, you may need to install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can do this by running the following commands:

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `streamlit run streamlit.py`

**Note:** It is recommended to use the official method provided by Anthropic to run **computer_use**. For more details, please refer to [this link](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo) for a safer experience.
